        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The NH CPR Challenge is a bipartisan initiative by New Hampshire's five Executive Councilors to train as many
            Granite Staters as possible in Hands-Only CPR during <strong>EMS Week 2026 (May 17&ndash;23)</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Each Executive Council district is competing to see who can train the most people. All trainings are
            <strong>completely free</strong> and take just <strong>15&ndash;20 minutes</strong>. No prior experience is needed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            The goal: give every New Hampshire resident the confidence to act if they witness a cardiac arrest.
            You don't need to be a medical professional&mdash;you just need to know two steps.

            For every minute that passes without CPR, a cardiac arrest victim's chance of survival drops 7&ndash;10%.
            When a bystander steps in immediately, they can double or triple the chance the person survives.
            <strong>Hands-Only CPR is simple, effective, and can be learned in minutes.</strong>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-4">What Is Hands-Only CPR?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Hands-Only CPR is CPR without mouth-to-mouth breaths. It's recommended for use by people who witness an
            adult or teen suddenly collapse. It has just two steps:

                <p class="text-lg font-bold text-navy-900 mb-2">Step 1: Call 911</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700">If you see someone suddenly collapse, call 911 immediately (or direct someone nearby to call). Every second counts.</p>

                <p class="text-lg font-bold text-navy-900 mb-2">Step 2: Push Hard &amp; Fast</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700">Place the heel of your hand on the center of the person's chest. Push hard and fast at a rate of 100&ndash;120 compressions per minute. Don't stop until professional help arrives.</p>

            <strong>Tip:</strong> Push to the beat of "Stayin' Alive" by the Bee Gees&mdash;it's about 100 beats per minute, the ideal compression rate.
